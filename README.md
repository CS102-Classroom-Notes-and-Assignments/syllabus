# Intro
Don't worry if you have never programmed before! This class is an *introduction* to programming concepts. This course assumes no prior knowledge, so no question is too basic.

The goal of this course is to prepare you for future programming classes such as Data Strucures and Algorithms I, as well as most other CS courses at Cooper. This class is also required for the CS minor. By the end of the course you will be able to use software to solve computational problems in your respective majors. Problem solving, “algorithmic thinking”, and proper methodologies for software development are emphasized throughout the course. 

Although the focus is on the C programming language, the course includes an introduction to working in a Linux environment, and the Python programming language. 


# Class Topics

Textbook: The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition - Kerninghan & Ritchie 

1. Introduction to Cooper Union’s Linux based computer systems, including: 
   * file structure
   * command line
   * text editors
   * compiling and executing code (including source code written across multiple text files).

2. Thinking algorithmically. Relating source code to its execution, taking into account the memory and speed, debugging, verification, error checking. Proper techniques for programming.

3. C programming:
   * Variables, data types, expressions, numeric and text data.
   * Conditional statements, loops, pointers, arrays.
   * Functions and scope of variables.
   * File I/O, displaying results including formatted printing and plotting.
   * Examples involving numeric computations and text processing.
   * Introduction to data structures and algorithms such as: C structures, linked lists, stacks, methods for searching and sorting.

4. Python programming:
   * Introduction to Python data types and expressions.
   * File I/O, formatted printing and plotting.
   * Introduction to common libraries such as matplotlib, numpy and pandas.


# Classwork Breakdown
We will be using Github Classroom for submitting all assignments. 

*Grading Breakdown:*
Programming assignments: 80% 
   * The grading rubric substantially considers both correctness of the solution and style (e.g., efficiency, clarity, quality of comments and other documentation).
   * All assignments given at the end of class must be turned in *before* the start of the next class. Revisions can be made to submitted homework by the next class for half credit. If your program does not run, it will be a 0.
   * Your program will be graded for Correctness: 85% Style: 15%

Quizzes: 20%
   *  There will be 4 quizzes throughout the semester which will be announced beforehand.

Grading:
* For the first assignment, there will be no late credit points deducted. If you submit the assignment correctly at any point, you will receive full credit. 
* For the second assignment, there will be no late credit points deducted. You can submit the HW for a second time with corrections to receive half of the lost points back.
* For the third assignment onwards, there will be late points deducted at 10% per day. You can submit each HW for a second time with corrections to receive half of the lost points back.

# Academic Honesty
Feel free to use online resources to learn code and look at code snippets, but blindly copying code from online or a peer is considered cheating and will result in a 0 for the assignment and an incident report. If you receive help from a classmate, please attribute the name of the classmate and show understanding of the code. 

# Who am I?
I graduated from Cooper Union with a B.E and M.Eng in Electrical/Computer Engineering, and now work at a startup doing Software Engineering. Feel free to contact me throughout the semester at my cooper email (subbaian@cooper.edu).


# ABET GOALS for the semester
1) An ability to identify, formulate and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics: Use of computing tools, principles of computer science.

2) An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety as well as economic factors:
Writing a program that achieves a certain goal (as opposed to, e.g., simply describing what a given segment of code accomplishes). Considerations of the “quality” of the solution, e.g., memory, speed, programming style (as being integral to the design of the program).

3) An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions:
Code testing and verification. Data visualization via plotting and other forms of formatted output.
